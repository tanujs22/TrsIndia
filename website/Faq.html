 <h4 font size="10"><b>How can Travelright help you?</b> </h4>
<h4>Delayed, cancelled or overbooked flights could entitle you to compensation of up to €600 per person.
We take care of the travel company and the tedious paperwork.
We will even sue if necessary to help you get your money.</h4>
<br>


<h4 font size="10"><b>Why Travelright?</b> </h4>
<h4>Our legal team has unique aviation expertise, unparalleled in Europe. 
The travel companies know us and they know that we don’t give up. 
Our experience and advanced technical systems will help you get compensation quickly and easily.</h4>
<br>

<h4 font size="10"><b>Which countries and airlines are subject to EU passenger rights?</b> </h4>
<h4>You can get compensated if you have been:</h4>
<h4><ul><li>travelling within the EU</li>
<li>leaving the EU with any airline</li>
<li>arriving into the EU with a carrier registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway or Switzerland </li> </ul> </h4>
<br>


<h4 font size="10"><b>How much compensation can I get?</b> </h4>
<h4>You can get from €250 – €600 depending on the distance of your journey:</h4>
<h4><ul><li>€250 for journeys up to 1500 km</li>
<li>€400 for journeys of 1500 km – 3500 km</li>
<li>€600 for journeys over 3500 km</li></ul></h4>
<br>

<h4 font size="10"><b>Do I have right to compensation due to a delay?</b> </h4>
<h4>If your journey is delayed by three or more hours, you (and everyone in your booking) are 
entitled to compensation of between €250 and €600. 
This also applies in case of multi-leg flights operated by the same airline.</h4>

<h4>You are not entitled to compensation if the airline can prove that the delay was caused by 
extraordinary circumstances (such as weather, strikes, an emergency or security) which could not 
have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.</h4>

<h4>Depending on the journey distance and length of delay you also have the right to 
phone calls, refreshments, meals, hotel accomodation and transportation. 
If the delay is over five hours and you decide not to continue your journey you 
have the right to a refund of the ticket and transportation back to where your flight originated.</h4>

<h4 font size="10"><b>Do I have right to compensation due to a cancellation?</b></h4>
<h4>If your flight is cancelled you are entitled to compensation of between €250 and €600, depending 
on the distance of the flight and the delays experienced before being re-routed.</h4>

<h4>You are not entitled to compensation if:
<ul><li>you were informed of the cancellation at least 14 days in advance</li>
<li>you were rerouted within (see table for exact regulations) of your original schedule</li>
<li>if the cancellation was caused by extraordinary circumstances (such as weather, strikes, emergencies or 
security) which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.</li></ul>
 
<h4>In addition the airline must offer you phone calls, refreshments, meals, hotel accommodation and transportation. 
You must also be offered the choice between reimbursement of your ticket within seven days or a re-routing 
to your final destination under similar conditions.</h4>

<h4>If you are denied boarding you are entitled to compensation of between €250 and €600 depending on the distance of the 
flight and the delays experienced as a result. The airline is obliged to first seek volunteers to give up their reservation 
in exchange for certain benefits. In addition, the airline must also offer volunteers the choice between a full refund and re-routing.</h4>

<h4 font size="10"><b>How much does it cost and when do I get paid?</b></h4>
<h4>If we don’t succeed we will not charge you, and we will cover all legal, court, administration and other costs related to the process,
simple as that! Our fee is 30%, VAT included.
As soon as we get the money from the travel company we will pay you, minus our share.</h4>
<br>

<h4 font size="10"><b>Why do Travelright take a share?</b></h4>
<h4>We invest a lot of time and effort into our cases, and to be able to cater to the ever-growing interest in our 
service and still retain a strict No Win – No Fee policy we need to take a small share. 
A percentage of our fee goes to running our business and the rest goes to charity.</h4>
<br>

<h4 font size="10"><b>Can I do the claim myself?</b></h4>
<h4>Yes, but there is a substantial risk that you will be rejected; therefore you have to be
 prepared to put in a lot of time and energy. Travel companies routinely blame everything on 
‘extraordinary circumstances outside the company’s control’ and that they took ‘all reasonable measures’ to correct the problem. 
If you have to go to court you risk ending up having to pay all the costs yourself.</h4>
<br>

<h4 font size="10"><b>How far back can I get compensation and do I need to pay tax?</b></h4>
<h4>In Sweden these claims are time barred after ten years and in other countries normally after three years. 
In Sweden this type of compensation is tax free. 
Please check with a local tax expert to get the correct information for your country.</h4>
<br>
<h4 font size="10"><b>Can I claim compensation from a flight that was paid for by my employer?</b></h4>
<h4>Yes the compensation is applicable to the passenger, not the person/organization that paid for the ticket.
If you are delayed on a business trip, you as a passenger can still claim compensation.</h4>
